In the initial years of YCCE, we had very limited resources and means to learn and grow. In the 80's with internet and google still decades away and with under equipped library, learning was through collaboration and deeper engagement with lecturers. It took more than just attending the lectures and practical labs to hone your engineering skills. In these challenging circumstances, we were very fortunate to have some of the best forward thinking YCCE professors, they with dedication nurtured our appetite for building a strong technical foundation along with a fearless attitude and progressive mindset - an important trait for technologists and engineers. When we graduated, the global technology revolution was on the horizon with US, Europe and Japan leading the way. In the hindsight, having witnessed the revolution, while playing an active part of it, I can now say that we were very fortunate to have selected YCCE ! I wish YCCE continued success and hope it keeps on delivering on it vision and further nurture the enormous potential of Indian youth. My best wishes! Last, but not the least, I pay my tribute and express deep gratitude to all my Professors, the Principal and Management of YCCE for creating a formidable foundation for technology learning and innovation.</div><div class="testimonial-content-n">Electronics Engineering, 1989</div><div class="testimonial-content-m"> Director (Services), Huawei Technologies India Pvt., Ltd.

YCCE is more than just a college. It has helped us carve our careers and build our personalities. Be it technical education, practical sessions, guest lectures, IT infrastructure, well equipped computer labs and importantly lecturers; YCCE had everything that was needed. IT department being relatively new branch had tremendous support and encouragement towards students. All the lecturers were really supportive and reachable. The bond with the lecturers was that strong and because of which we are still in touch with them and the department. Thanks for the wonderful and unforgettable experience we had in those four years. I personally look forward for the continued relations with the department.</div><div class="testimonial-content-n">Information Technology, 2009</div><div class="testimonial-content-m"> Project lead, Persistent System, Nagpur.</div></div></div> </li><li style="width: 446px; float: left; display: block;"><div class="col-md-12"><div class="testimonial-m-home-box"><div class="testimonial-img-n"> <img src="./Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur_files/prashnt-borkar.jpg" alt=" testimonial" draggable="false"></div><div class="testimonial-name">Dr. Prashant Nanaji Borkar</div><div class="testi-discpription-home">YCCE offers a blend of learning, enjoyment and an integration of enduring principles.

What amazes me is the plethora of extracurricular activities that the institute offers hence compelling individuals to explore and pursue extra talents while inculcating the spirit to stand out amongst the talented hardworking students. Another feather in the cap is the professors who impact the quality education to its students. The infrastructure of the institute speaks for itself. YCCE was like my family. A family that will be a part of me for the rest of my life.</div><div class="testimonial-content-n">Information Technology, 2010</div><div class="testimonial-content-m"> Head of Department, Computer Science &amp; Engg., In-charge - MIS and Center of Excellence Data Science, G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur</div></div></div> </li><li style="width: 446px; float: left; display: block;"><div class="col-md-12"><div class="testimonial-m-home-box"><div class="testimonial-img-n"> <img src="./Yeshwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur_files/pranany-saraf.jpg" alt=" testimonial" draggable="false"></div><div class="testimonial-name">Pranay Deepak Saraf</div><div class="testi-discpription-home">Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school/college, Rightly said by Albert Einstein, world famous scientist.

The culture is excellent, and technical, as well as nontechnical events, are most extensive in central India. Also, the department provided with advanced labs and facilities. The curriculum provided was well thought and relevant to the industry as well as the core fundamentals of the stream.
